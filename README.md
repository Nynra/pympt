## Modified Mercle-Patricia Tree
This repository is a python implementation of a MPT. Most the used code was copied from [here](https://github.com/popzxc/merkle-patricia-trie/blob/master/LICENSE) under [MIT licence]('\\docs')

### Explanations
It took me quite a while to understand what a MPT is and how it can be used.
These are some usefull guides

### Installation
The biggest change for a stable tree is using one of the releases of the releases branch. If there are no releases or none that fit you try the nightly rleases or build your own wheel file.
